If you want the file you can find it on original post linked at the beggining.

## Components 
Recomended to purchase allways more in case of failure soldering or factory error.
I bought 10 of each to build 8 trackers.

- TP4056
- Wemos D1 Mini
- BMI160
- 50MM Straps and Universal Chest Harness Chest
- SS12D00G3 (switch)
- Battery 804040 1800 mAh or 2500 mAh ( 2500mAh used)
- 1N5817 Diode (2x)
- 180K Ohm resistor
  
## Straps
This proyect was shared for people who prefer use straps 50mm (2 inch), you can DIY your own by using 2inch elastic and cut it on your size.
For this proyect I used 2 types of straps:

### 1.Chest
Universal Chest Harness Chest
(Link bellow)

### 2. Legs, arms and hips.
Straps highly recomended: brand "Trilancer" 46x5 cm ( pack of 8)
(Link bellow)
Pro: 
-Non-Slip Silicone that keep trackers on place,confable, afortable and not need to sew.
Cons:
- No big enough for hip tracking,neccesasy to attach 2 or more togueter to get wished lenght.
  
## 3D printables files
This componenst are specifically for use with battery 804040, diferent sizes will be updates in the future.
You can find STL. files on 3D models folder :)

### Single Trackers
To build single trackers is neccesary to print ( consider amount depending of how many trackers you need!):
-x1 Case 
-x1 Top
-x1 Tray

### Chest Tracker
-x1 Chest case
-x1 Top
-x1 Tray
