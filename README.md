## Straps
This proyect was shared for people who prefer use straps 50mm (2 inch), you can DIY your own by using 2inch elastic and cut it on your size.
For this proyect I used 2 types of straps:

### 2. Legs, arms and hips.

Straps highly recomended: brand "Trilancer" 46x5 cm ( pack of 8)
(Link bellow)
Pro: 
-Non-Slip Silicone that keep trackers on place,confable, afortable and not need to sew.
Cons:
- No big enough for hip tracking,neccesasy to attach 2 or more togueter to get wished lenght.
  
## 3D printables files
This componenst are specifically for use with battery 804040, diferent sizes will be updates in the future.
You can find STL. files on 3D models folder :)
